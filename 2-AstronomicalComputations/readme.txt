We use Swiss Ephemeris for the astronomical computations,
something else could be used too, as both input and output
of this module are .csv files with comma-separated values.

See ftp://www.astro.com/pub/swisseph
and then ftp://www.astro.com/pub/swisseph/00readme.txt
and also ftp://www.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/README.TXT

Howto_timeToLonSid.bat is not too slow:
it finishes after approx. 5 minutes on a 5 year old laptop.
