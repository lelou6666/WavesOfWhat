A list of things to do, sorted by importance, more important first

1. Other test sets:
   1a. Code for fetching from elsewhere (e.g. Wikipedia - this is a work in progress) and cleaning
   1b. Code for applying trained classifiers to a variety of test sets

2. Try One-vs-All instead of One-vs-One approach. Training sets will get bigger.

3. Try excluding planets from current set {Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto}
   Try including from set {Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Eris, etc},
   perhaps even planetary orbital points like ascending node and aphelion?

3a. Try feature selection algorithms implemented in scikit-learn?

4. Try clustering algorithms implemented in scikit-learn?

5. Apply all classifiers in sections Longitudes and SIDs (instead of just three classifiers).
