A list of things to do, sorted by importance, more important first

1. Other test sets:
   1a. Code for fetching from elsewhere, e.g. Wikipedia, and cleaning
   1b. Code for applying trained classifiers to a variety of test sets

2. See "TODO:" in Validation_and_testing.py

3. Output is sometimes different (though more often same) on different computers.
   Why? and how should this be fixed?

4. Try clustering algorithms implemented in scikit-learn?
