A list of things to do, sorted by importance, more important first

1. Other test sets:
   1a. Code for fetching from elsewhere (e.g. Wikipedia - this is a work in progress) and cleaning
   1b. Code for applying trained classifiers to a variety of test sets

2. Try excluding planets from current set {Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto}
   Try including from set {Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Eris, etc},
   perhaps even orbital points like apogee and aphelion?

3. Output the median accuracy across numIterations, or maybe min(median, mean),
   because currently who knows, maybe most of the time accuracy is just slightly higher than 0.5,
   only sometimes much much higher and this forces the mean to jump significantly higher than 0.5
